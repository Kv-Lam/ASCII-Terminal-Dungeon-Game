What went well:
    Our group worked very well together, as we constantly communicated, worked together, and used GitHub to manage files.
    Both of us finished our assigned tasks in a timely manner, and helped the other if they were struggling. 
    We were also able to work well coding together despite our differences in syntax preference. (Mainly me enforcing my syntax, sorry (not sorry) - Kevin)

What went less well:
    Nothing went wrong in particular. There were some difficulties running our program on the Tesla Machine,
    but we were able to resolve the issue in around two hours alongside the help of the TAs (Thank you! Especially Maggie!). 
    As stated previously, we worked well together and helped each other if we needed it, so there wasn't much of anything that went poorly.

What we learned/Why we should get full discretionary points:
    We learned how to work together as a team, time manage, and divide and conquer the task we had before us.
    We worked for a long time on this project (combined total ~24 hours) and we are happy with the final project
    and hope that others enjoy it as well. Additionally, we learned GitHub for this project and it was extraordinarily helpful.
