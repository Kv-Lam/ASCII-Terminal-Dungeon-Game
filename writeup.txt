    What went well:

        We worked well and effectively in our group. Both of us finished what was assigned to the both of us in
        the time we needed, and we helped each other if one of us was struggling. We were also able to work well
        coding together despite our differences in syntax preference.

    What went less well:

        Nothing went wrong in particular. There were some difficulties running our program on the Tesla Machine,
        but we were able to resolve the issue without too much trouble. As stated previously, we worked well together
        and helped each other if we needed it, so there wasn't much of anything that went poorly.

    What we learned/Why we should get full discretionary points:

        We learned how to work together as a team, time manage, and divide and conquer the task we had before us.
        We worked for a long time on this project (combined total ~24 hours) and we are happy with the final project
        and hope that others enjoy it as well.
