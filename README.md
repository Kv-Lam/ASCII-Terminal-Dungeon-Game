This project is a terminal-based text dungeon game based on the MUD lab from CS102. It applies the same concept of utilizing a pointer to an array of room structures. However, it has been built upon to have actual playability by implementing a character, enemies, a somewhat basic combat system, stats, and an inventory with item usage. Furthermore, the project includes an improved version of the look command to print ASCII room art included inside of the file given via argument line.

How to run: ./mud (fileName)
